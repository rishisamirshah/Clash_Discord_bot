# Clash_Discord_bot
This is a discord bot that uses the clash of clans api to print data
This is code that runs a discord bot using the Discord API, from the cloud.

The Current Implementation allows the Discord bot to print information from the Clash of Clans API

Documentation regarding that can be found here. https://developer.clashofclans.com/#/documentation

At the current state of my code, the only two commands avaliable are $trophies which prints the # of trophies of a player in Clash of Clans using their clan Tag. 

Furthermore, the second command is $clantags which takes a clan and prints all clan members name in a clan.
